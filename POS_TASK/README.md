# POS_TASK - Arabic POS Tagging (NLP ITI Project)

This repository contains advanced implementations for Arabic Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging developed as part of the NLP module in the ITI 9-Month AI Professional Training Program.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project tackles POS tagging on **Arabic text**, a morphologically rich and complex language. It leverages both:
- **Pretrained transformer models** from Hugging Face (e.g., BERT)
- **Custom LSTM-based models** for sequence labeling

Working with Arabic poses challenges in tokenization, diacritics, and sparse resources, making this project a non-trivial and advanced undertaking in NLP.

## 🧠 Methodology

### ✅ Dataset
- Arabic POS-tagged corpora with manually or publicly annotated data.

### ✅ Preprocessing
- Text normalization
- Tokenization adapted to Arabic language rules
- Label encoding for sequence tagging

### ✅ Models
- **Hugging Face Transformers**  
  Finetuned models such as `bert-base-arabic` or similar for token classification using Hugging Face `transformers`.

- **LSTM-based Architecture**  
  Custom bidirectional LSTM with Embedding layers and CRF/softmax output for sequential classification.

### ✅ Evaluation
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score (per label)
- Confusion matrix

## ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
- nltk
- transformers
- torch
- seqeval (for sequence tagging metrics)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk torch transformers seqeval
````

## 📊 Results

* Hugging Face models achieved high accuracy on fine-tuned Arabic datasets, showing strong generalization.
* LSTM-based models performed well but required careful hyperparameter tuning due to Arabic token variability.

## 🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository and open either notebook:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HajarElbehairy/NLP_ITI.git
cd NLP_ITI/POS_TASK
```

* For transformer-based tagging: `fintuning_POS_Arabic.ipynb`
* For LSTM-based tagging: `POS_tagging_ARABIC_LSTM.ipynb`

Use Jupyter or VS Code to run the notebook interactively.

## 💡 Highlights

* ✅ Works with **Arabic**, a challenging and less-resourced language.
* ✅ Applies **Hugging Face Transformers**, a state-of-the-art NLP framework.
* ✅ Demonstrates deep learning via **LSTM models** for sequence labeling.
